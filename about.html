        <h2 class="subtitle">Made In Mississippi</h2>
        <p>"Come home when the streetlights come on," my mom used to say to me. Dirt under my nails and fresh off hours of imagination, I finally did. Barefoot adventures in the <strong>Mississippi Delta</strong> branded me: disciplined, instinctive, bold. But small-town dreams need sculpting. So after high school, I moved to Savannah, Georgia where I earned my degree at the <strong>Savannah College of Art and Design</strong> in 2007. After that, I did a brief stint in New York, but the Big Apple proved to be just a little to big for this southern chick.</p>
        <p>Today, I'm living in <strong>Louisville</strong>, Kentucky and working as a <strong>UX designer at Humana</strong>. With <strong>12 years of professional design experience</strong>, I have a keen eye for both <strong>digital and print</strong>; my background includes <strong>UX/UI, branding, layout, art direction, and app and website design</strong>. Over the years, I have collaborated with some pretty awesome humans including developers, marketers, copywriters, clients, photographers, and stylists.</p>
