  <p>"Come home when the streetlights come on," my mom used to say to me. Dirt under my nails and fresh off hours of imagination. I did. Barefoot adventures in Rolling Fork, Mississippi branded me: disciplined, instictive, bold. But small-town dreams need sculpting. After high school, I moved to Savannah, Geogia where I finished my degree at the prestigious Savannah College of Art and Design.</p>

  <p>Today, I'm an award-winning designer with more than a decade of experience in digital, print, logo, and layout design. I'm the Art Directory at DBS Interactive, a full-service digital agency in Louisville, KY. Every client is unique, and every day requires a different design solution. The quality of that work never waves and neither does my aim--outstanding and hardworking user-centric design</p>
