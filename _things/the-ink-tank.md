The Ink Tank features a hypnotic design that draws attention to ink inspiration, education and trends that show the depth and breadth Kao Collins. I designed The Ink Tank to have a bold, modern aesthetic. A minimalist home page draws attention to strong positioning copy and directs readers to popular content. A laser focus on typeface, header styles, and paragraph spacing put readability first.

The Ink Tank received acclaim from designers and industry professionals alike. In addition to winning a Summit Creative Award, the Ink Tank was featured on Creative Bloq as a “best of” example of WordPress websites, and 17 different ink and inkjet industry publications ran stories on the site after launch. It doubled the overall traffic to the Kao Collins website and significantly boosted organic search engine traffic. It proves that out-of-the-box thinking makes for innovative inking.
