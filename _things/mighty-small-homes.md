# Mighty Small Homes is a local startup selling sustainable home kits direct to consumers.

I worked with a marketing team to build Mighty Small Homes’ brand from the ground up, including logo design, website design, marketing collateral, and branding guidelines. The biggest challenge being that when this project began, there were no actual small homes, just drafts of plans. So before any sort of branding could start, a 3D modeler and I worked together to design the look of the small home products.

The website’s design showcases the brand’s core messages: sustainability and simple living. A custom mega-menu created an intuitive user path that should lead to more conversions. I led 3D modelers and front-end designers in creating assets that made the website the best in its niche market.

After launch, I’ve worked with the company owners and marketing team to design additional marketing materials, including business cards, trade show banners, and social media assets.
