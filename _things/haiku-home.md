# Haiku Home gives customers an informative and intuitive space to buy fans and lights.

Haiku Home is a new venture from Big Ass Solutions and the company’s first foray into residential lights and fans. Designed to help you upgrade the IQ and style of your house, Haiku’s slick selection of modern ceiling fans and LED ceiling lights come pre-equipped with the latest in smart home technology. As a new brand tailoring itself to residential consumers, Haiku Home desperately needed an online shopping experience that could match the intelligence of their fans.

The website is clean and modern, a purposeful design choice that puts products first and feels intuitive and familiar for the brand’s target demographics. The Haiku Fan Builder helps new visitors choose between the three different series. Each decision a shopper makes refines their selection until they are left with only their dream fan. The builder kicks the user to the respective Series page where they can complete their order.

Every image within the Haiku Home gallery links to the respective fan in the photo, sending users to the Series selector where they can further customize it before adding it to their cart. Users can filter the gallery by indoor and outdoor fans.
