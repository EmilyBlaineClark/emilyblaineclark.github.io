# Mighty Small Homes is a local startup selling sustainable home kits direct to consumers.

I worked with a marketing team to build Mighty Small Homes’ brand from the ground up, including logo design, palette and type selections, and branding guidelines.

The website’s design showcases the brand’s core messages: sustainability and simple living. A custom mega-menu created an intuitive user path that should lead to more conversions. I led 3D modelers and front-end designers in creating assets that made the website the best in its niche market.

After launch, I’ve worked with the company owners and marketing team to design additional marketing materials, including business cards, trade show banners, and social media assets.
