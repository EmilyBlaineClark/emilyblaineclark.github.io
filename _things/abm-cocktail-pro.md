# American Beverage Marketers is an industry-leading provider of premium cocktail mixes.

ABM Cocktail Pro was designed to give bartenders, restaurant owners and distributors easy access to creative drink recipes and provide targeted attention to current and new ABM cocktail mixer products.

The simple interface features a bright palette that complements the colorful cocktail photography provided by the client. Although ABM had an existing brand and website, I created a new logo for the app and helped name it. Clear calls-to-action make the app easy to navigate but also encourage specific user actions.
