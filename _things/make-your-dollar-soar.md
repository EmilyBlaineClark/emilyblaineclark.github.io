# The Make Your Dollar Soar infographic was the centerpiece of a regional fundraising push.

Leadership Louisville needed a creative way to show the power of community investment while they raised money for the new Leadership Louisville Center building.

The idea for the basis of the infographic came from a friend of mine. When asked “What comes to mind when you think of a dollar bill and how that one dollar can multiply to make a difference?” Michael Polston responded “I think of folding that dollar into a little paper airplane, like you do when you’re a kid. And then I guess from there, it could fly and follow a path.” From that, the concept of the Leadership Louisville dollar airplane and flight plan came to be.

The interactive infographic allowed visitors to see first-hand the difference one dollar can make in the community. Using Google’s Street View, I was able to sit in the office and create custom illustrations of Louisville businesses and buildings.
